<blockquote>Make friends with pain, and you will never be alone. ‚Äî Ken Chlouber (creator of the Leadville Trail 100)</blockquote><p>I don‚Äôt enter running races often - just a few times a year - but when I do race I really enjoy it. The Long Distance Walkers Association organise ‚Äòchallenge events‚Äô and this week I‚Äôll share my recent experience of the Sidmouth Saunter - an 18 or 30-mile walk or run through the east Devon countryside.</p><h1 id="%F0%9F%8F%85-the-sidmouth-saunter">üèÖ The Sidmouth Saunter</h1><p>The Sidmouth Saunter is a walking and running event organised by the Long Distance Walkers Association (LDWA). It‚Äôs held every two years, alternating with the sister race the Devonshire Dumpling.</p><p>There are two routes - an 18-mile option and a 30-mile option. I opted for the 18-mile option this time, as a last long run before the Bristol Half Marathon that is 3 weeks later.</p><p>Walkers start at 8 am, runners at 9 am. I love LDWA events because the routes are great (scenery, trails, etc), they are informal and friendly, and above all are so cheap!</p><p>The event has a few checkpoints with food and drink but is otherwise self-supported. The route isn‚Äôt marked or marshalled, it‚Äôs a self-navigation event. I ran with the GPX route loaded onto my phone and with a turn-by-turn printout of the course. This makes it tricky and interesting because you need to run at the same time as reading the map and route description! I took a couple of minor wrong turns this time, but nothing major.</p><p>The 18-mile route that I did is shown on the OS map below, followed by the elevation profile. 600m of ascent/descent is pretty hilly and certainly makes for a challenging route.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="/src/assets/images/2023/04/2023-04-25-06-31-15.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="828" height="1240" srcset="/src/assets/images/size/w600/2023/04/2023-04-25-06-31-15.jpeg 600w, /src/assets/images/2023/04/2023-04-25-06-31-15.jpeg 828w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="/src/assets/images/2023/04/2023-04-25-06-31-21.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="828" height="462" srcset="/src/assets/images/size/w600/2023/04/2023-04-25-06-31-21.jpeg 600w, /src/assets/images/2023/04/2023-04-25-06-31-21.jpeg 828w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>I don't race that often but when I do it is good fun. There is a step change in mental and physical performance when racing compared to training. You can go to deeper places and access and greater well of fortitude.</p><p>For me, things start to get interesting when I reach about the 2-hour mark. That‚Äôs when I start to feel more emotion and have to dig deep to find the resolve I need to keep pushing. Music helps when I reach this point because it connects to the more primal side that is activated at this point. I have an ‚Äúepic running‚Äù playlist of big songs and emotional music.</p><p>The transition to this mental state is wonderful in hindsight, a real soul search. It makes crossing that finish line an achievement to be proud of.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="/src/assets/images/2023/04/IMG_2191.JPG" width="2000" height="1500" loading="lazy" alt srcset="/src/assets/images/size/w600/2023/04/IMG_2191.JPG 600w, /src/assets/images/size/w1000/2023/04/IMG_2191.JPG 1000w, /src/assets/images/size/w1600/2023/04/IMG_2191.JPG 1600w, /src/assets/images/size/w2400/2023/04/IMG_2191.JPG 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="/src/assets/images/2023/04/IMG_2193.JPG" width="2000" height="1500" loading="lazy" alt srcset="/src/assets/images/size/w600/2023/04/IMG_2193.JPG 600w, /src/assets/images/size/w1000/2023/04/IMG_2193.JPG 1000w, /src/assets/images/size/w1600/2023/04/IMG_2193.JPG 1600w, /src/assets/images/size/w2400/2023/04/IMG_2193.JPG 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="/src/assets/images/2023/04/IMG_2197.JPG" width="2000" height="1500" loading="lazy" alt srcset="/src/assets/images/size/w600/2023/04/IMG_2197.JPG 600w, /src/assets/images/size/w1000/2023/04/IMG_2197.JPG 1000w, /src/assets/images/size/w1600/2023/04/IMG_2197.JPG 1600w, /src/assets/images/size/w2400/2023/04/IMG_2197.JPG 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="/src/assets/images/2023/04/IMG_2206.JPG" width="2000" height="1500" loading="lazy" alt srcset="/src/assets/images/size/w600/2023/04/IMG_2206.JPG 600w, /src/assets/images/size/w1000/2023/04/IMG_2206.JPG 1000w, /src/assets/images/size/w1600/2023/04/IMG_2206.JPG 1600w, /src/assets/images/size/w2400/2023/04/IMG_2206.JPG 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="/src/assets/images/2023/04/IMG_2210.JPG" width="2000" height="1500" loading="lazy" alt srcset="/src/assets/images/size/w600/2023/04/IMG_2210.JPG 600w, /src/assets/images/size/w1000/2023/04/IMG_2210.JPG 1000w, /src/assets/images/size/w1600/2023/04/IMG_2210.JPG 1600w, /src/assets/images/size/w2400/2023/04/IMG_2210.JPG 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="/src/assets/images/2023/04/IMG_2217.JPG" width="2000" height="1500" loading="lazy" alt srcset="/src/assets/images/size/w600/2023/04/IMG_2217.JPG 600w, /src/assets/images/size/w1000/2023/04/IMG_2217.JPG 1000w, /src/assets/images/size/w1600/2023/04/IMG_2217.JPG 1600w, /src/assets/images/size/w2400/2023/04/IMG_2217.JPG 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="/src/assets/images/2023/04/IMG_2254.JPG" width="2000" height="1500" loading="lazy" alt srcset="/src/assets/images/size/w600/2023/04/IMG_2254.JPG 600w, /src/assets/images/size/w1000/2023/04/IMG_2254.JPG 1000w, /src/assets/images/size/w1600/2023/04/IMG_2254.JPG 1600w, /src/assets/images/size/w2400/2023/04/IMG_2254.JPG 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div><figcaption>Photos from race day</figcaption></figure><h1 id="%F0%9F%94%AE-lessons-for-future-races">üîÆ Lessons for future races</h1><p>In terms of what I learnt from this event, specifically in relation to my upcoming Bristol Half Marathon, it‚Äôs this:</p><h2 id="pre-race">Pre-race:</h2><ul><li>My pre-race meal was 6 scrambled eggs with Serrano ham and a glass of homemade kefir. A high-fat and protein and zero carb breakfast. The idea here is that no fibre will be easier on my stomach and that the ketogenic breakfast will keep me in ‚Äòfat-burner‚Äô mode for fuel as opposed to glucose burning. I will likely keep the same except to add some honey for a bit of easily digestible carbs.</li><li>For chaffing I plastered my nipples and used talc powder for my groin and feet.</li><li>Next time I will have more electrolytes beforehand.</li></ul><h2 id="during">During:</h2><ul><li>I carried a little tin of salt which worked well for adding electrolytes to the water at the checkpoints.</li><li>I applied Vaseline to my groin when I felt some friction.</li><li>I drank only water, with salt added. I should drink more electrolytes next time though.</li><li>I had a few handfuls of raisins as my only source of fuel.</li><li>Self-navigation was tricky using the printout provided. Next time I‚Äôll rewrite the instructions in a numbered list so I can better follow them.</li><li>I‚Äôm undecided on whether I‚Äôll run in my calf sleeves or just use them for post-race recovery.</li></ul><h2 id="post-race">Post-race:</h2><ul><li>I used my calf compression sleeves to aid recovery.</li><li>I had an Epsom salt bath.</li><li>I ate cleanly afterwards - ie didn‚Äôt just chomp on all the sweets and chocolate (!!) but ate real food.</li></ul><p>And that‚Äôs it. In the last few weeks before the Half I‚Äôll do a taper of sorts with my running mileage, not that I‚Äôm running that much anyway. I will also do some visualisation exercises because the mind needs training as much as the body. And finally, I will use my cork massage balls and foam roller to iron out any kinks and knots.</p><p>With that, I should be ready to have a blast around a half-marathon course, in what will be my first big city road race in many, many years.</p><p>Keep on running.</p><hr><p>It‚Äôs a pleasure writing to you. Have a great week. üòä</p><p>Nick</p><h3 id="about-the-saturday-blueprint">About the Saturday Blueprint</h3><p>The <a href="/blog/newsletter/">Saturday Blueprint</a> is a weekly newsletter every Saturday on health, vitality and philosophy by <a href="/blog/">Nick Stevens</a>.</p><p>Join the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/devonblueprint/">Facebook page</a> to interact with the community.</p>
