<blockquote>If you‚Äôre thinking without writing, you only think you‚Äôre thinking. ‚Äî Leslie Lamport</blockquote><blockquote>Words have a longevity I do not. ‚Äî Paul Kalanithiz</blockquote><p>‚ÄåThis week I explore the benefits of writing, how writing helps you think, and how writing is a great creativity enabler. I‚Äôll also cover how I write and the tools I use.</p><h1 id="%E2%9C%8D%EF%B8%8F-writing-is-thinking">‚úçÔ∏è Writing is thinking</h1><p><em>I wrote specifically about why I‚Äôm writing a memoir in <a href="www.nickjstevens.com/saturday-blueprint-on-writing-your-story">Saturday Blueprint 21 on Writing Your Story</a> so check that out if you missed it.</em></p><p><strong>Writing is not the result of thinking, writing is thinking.</strong><br><br>To write more is to <em>be</em> more, to <em>feel</em> more, to <em>see</em> more. In many ways writing is like constructively talking with yourself. An open conversation with your inner self.</p><p>Because writing is a form of expression it improves my own understanding of what I‚Äôm writing and helps organise my thoughts. Ultimately then it improves my ability to express what I think and feel, a great benefit when a lot of the time we go around not knowing what it is we want or hope for or are scared of.</p><p>You‚Äôve got to understand what you‚Äôre writing about, at least on some level, so writing in some way is cognition. The paper, virtual or not, extends the surface area of your cognition. You‚Äôve got more room to manoeuvre, more runway. Think of when you work out a tricky maths sum - it‚Äôs much easier when you can write down your working as you go. Another example is a simple shopping todo list - it‚Äôs much harder trying to keep in your head vs the improved extension of your brain by writing it down.</p><p>As we write and as we think we make mental associations and connections. Little sparks of understanding of how <em>this</em> thing reminds you of <em>that</em> thing. As you‚Äôll see when I share the tool I use for writing this can be a feature of a digital tool. In any case, making connections between thoughts and ideas leads to knew ways of understanding and often some original ideas too. This harks back to the <a href="https://zenkit.com/en/blog/a-beginners-guide-to-the-zettelkasten-method/">Zettelkasten Method</a> which I‚Äôll have to write about in the future.</p><p>In terms of how I write. I keep that simple. I commit to making writing a daily habit, and it‚Äôs part of my morning routine. I tick off each day I write even if it‚Äôs just for a few minutes. My only goal is to write; I don‚Äôt set an arbitrary time of word count. I flip around between exploring different topics, often having up to a dozen pieces on the go at any one time. This is also a ‚Äòhack‚Äô for making it as easy a possible - if I have a bunch of topics in progress then there is more chance that one of them will take my fancy when I sit down and write.</p><p>Writing is the best tool for thinking. So what is the best tool for writing? The tool that gives you least friction to write a little each day. For me I use <a href="https://logseq.com">logseq</a>, a markdown-based note taking app. I do 95% of my writing on my phone. Not because that‚Äôs the perfect tool but because it‚Äôs the <em>easiest</em> tool. A huge feature of logseq is the ability to ‚Äúconnect the dots‚Äù with the bidirectional links, this makes it so natural and organic to relate ideas together.</p><h1 id="%F0%9F%8E%A8-writing-is-creativity">üé® Writing is creativity</h1><p>Creativity, whether in writing or in any other area, is a process that involves action. You‚Äôve got to <em>do</em> something to <em>be</em> creative.</p><p>I‚Äôve previously shared my haiku in a <a href="/blog/100-days-of-haiku/">100 days of haiku challenge</a>. Now this is a purely creative endeavour. There is no apparent benefit from writing haiku. But the <em>process</em> of doing it is a small action towards opening my mind and creating the environment for creativity.</p><p>The beauty of creative poetry like haiku is that there is no right answer. Or rather, they are all the right answer, since the answer is in the writing, not in what is written.</p><p><strong>Writing is a creative process with no wrong answer.</strong></p><p>You might say that, like art, it‚Äôs value is found in the eyes of those who see it. And with enough eyes, someone, surely, will see the beauty. But that‚Äôs not quite right, there is no ‚Äòeye of the beholder‚Äô that matters, it‚Äôs more fundamental than that. <strong>The value is in the <em>process</em> itself. The very act of writing makes you a writer</strong>.</p><p>It doesn‚Äôt matter if anyone reads it. This blog for example is hardly ever read - thank you if you‚Äôre reading this üòä - but that‚Äôs ok. I‚Äôve already gained my value from the practice of doing the writing.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="/src/assets/images/2023/02/florian-klauer-mk7D-4UCfmg-unsplash.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2933" srcset="/src/assets/images/size/w600/2023/02/florian-klauer-mk7D-4UCfmg-unsplash.jpg 600w, /src/assets/images/size/w1000/2023/02/florian-klauer-mk7D-4UCfmg-unsplash.jpg 1000w, /src/assets/images/size/w1600/2023/02/florian-klauer-mk7D-4UCfmg-unsplash.jpg 1600w, /src/assets/images/size/w2400/2023/02/florian-klauer-mk7D-4UCfmg-unsplash.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h1 id="%E2%9E%95-other-thoughts">‚ûï Other thoughts</h1><p>The two reasons above on thinking and creativity are the main reasons, but there are a few other points worth noting.</p><p>The first is that writing is a <a href="/blog/saturday-blueprint-on-habits-and-routines/">habit</a>. Just like a physical bicep curl, a daily mental workout - putting the reps in - is a bicep curl for your brain. It‚Äôs a small but doable moment of discipline each day, to work towards something that matters to you.</p><p>The second is that there is little, if any, downside of writing, but the potential upside is large. It could be that in writing there is some idea breakthrough or aha moment. Maybe you‚Äôll get tapped up by a publisher, or a long lost friend will reach out to you having read your words. This is a classic asymmetric situation - where the downside is small and fixed and the upside is essentially unlimited. I‚Äôll write more on this too in the future because there is a fantastic book on this called <a href="https://amzn.eu/d/evsOZDr">Antifragile</a> and it‚Äôs a fascinating topic area that really makes you consider your actions.</p><p>It‚Äôs a pleasure writing to you.
