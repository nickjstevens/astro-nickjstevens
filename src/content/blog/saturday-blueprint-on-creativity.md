<p>Hi 👋. Here is this week's Saturday Blueprint.</p><h1 id="%F0%9F%A4%94-quote-i%E2%80%99m-thinking-about">🤔 Quote I’m thinking about:</h1><blockquote>Every now and again take a good look at something not made with hands — a mountain, a star, the turn of a stream. There will come to you wisdom and patience and solace and, above all, the assurance that you are not alone in the world — Sidney Lovett</blockquote><p>This is a beautiful quote and really captures the power and stillness that comes from nature. In many ways he’s also expressing that the root of mindfulness is in just <em>looking</em>. Just <em>noticing</em>. What results is a feeling of connection with nature, with the universe. And with that deep connection how can you possibly feel alone? The connection is already there of course - you are already part of the universe - but you need to look  to notice it and to feel it.</p><p>A walk or trail run on Dartmoor is my happy place for feeling and noticing this connection with nature and the universe. The gorse, the tumbling brooks, the moss, the wind-blown rocks. What about you? Where would you go?</p><h1 id="%F0%9F%8E%B5-musical-philosophy">🎵 Musical philosophy</h1><p>There is a power and beauty in music. I like to find snippets of lyrics that resonate with me. Another of my happy places is (of all places) doing the washing up and listening to music. I don’t need to think and I can just get lost in the music and the moment.</p><p>I’m aware that music preference is like marmite - but here are some lyrics (and artists) I heard this week that I’d like to write about, with a theme of hopes and dreams.</p><blockquote>“Everyone I used to know<br>Left their dreams by the door” — My Wrecking Ball by Ryan Adams</blockquote><p>I love a bit of Ryan Adams. Great acoustic Americana. This lyric on dreams makes me reflect over this cup of coffee - where are my dreams, hopes, desires? In fact, <em>what</em> are my dreams even? I alternate from the Stoic position that dreams are attachments and thus should be discarded to find peace and freedom. Any desire is a chance to practice strength of will and moderation (or temperance to use one of the four cardinal Stoic virtues). But then I’m also a dreamer and sensitive soul who wants to strive, to have it all, to <em>feel</em>.  And navigating that dichotomy is philosophy in a nutshell I guess! At least this cup of coffee in my hands anchors me to the present.</p><blockquote>“But take your time, think a lot<br>Think of everything you've got<br>For you will still be here tomorrow<br>But your dreams may not” — Father and Son by Cat Stevens</blockquote><p>If you’re a father, or a son, or both, the lyrics to this song tug right on the heart strings. It feels like it captures the dichotomy of my life in one song. And this snippet is a message in mindfulness and gratitude if ever I’ve heard it. On a daily basis I take so much for granted: my health, my family, the roof over my head, the country I live in. Tomorrow will likely come, but my dreams…? Well… I’ll settle for thinking about everything I’ve got for the time being…</p><p>Music has meaning. What music resonates (no pun intended) with you, and why?</p><h1 id="%F0%9F%AA%A2-perception-vs-reality">🪢 Perception vs Reality</h1><p>How we see the world rarely reflects what the world is actually like.</p><p>You don’t need to dare to be different, because everyone is different. Just be yourself. No one can out “you” you. Or, in sketch form:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="/src/assets/images/2022/05/00AB80AC-EB64-430C-813E-429AA7949FA0_1_105_c.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" srcset="/src/assets/images/size/w600/2022/05/00AB80AC-EB64-430C-813E-429AA7949FA0_1_105_c.jpeg 600w, /src/assets/images/size/w1000/2022/05/00AB80AC-EB64-430C-813E-429AA7949FA0_1_105_c.jpeg 1000w, /src/assets/images/2022/05/00AB80AC-EB64-430C-813E-429AA7949FA0_1_105_c.jpeg 1024w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>So I can't draw sheep, but I do enjoy creating these sketches. Here's an offer - give me a concept or idea and I’ll create a sketch note for you - just drop me a <a href="/blog/contact/">message or email</a>.</p><h1 id="%F0%9F%96%8B-creative-writing-and-melancholy">🖋 Creative writing and melancholy</h1><p>I'm an engineer, but I do find writing a worthy outlet. Here is a short story I wrote on growing old - a little piece of creative writing. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-bookmark-card"><a class="kg-bookmark-container" href="/blog/margot-and-gracie/"><div class="kg-bookmark-content"><div class="kg-bookmark-title">Margot and Gracie</div><div class="kg-bookmark-description">A short story on growing old</div><div class="kg-bookmark-metadata"><img class="kg-bookmark-icon" src="/blog/favicon.png" alt=""><span class="kg-bookmark-author">Nick J Stevens</span><span class="kg-bookmark-publisher">Nick Stevens</span></div></div><div class="kg-bookmark-thumbnail"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1597572376022-df1b82a39c1d?crop&#x3D;entropy&amp;cs&#x3D;tinysrgb&amp;fit&#x3D;max&amp;fm&#x3D;jpg&amp;ixid&#x3D;MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDd8fEJlbmNoJTIwd2lsbG93JTIwdHJlZXxlbnwwfHx8fDE2NTMyMDE0ODI&amp;ixlib&#x3D;rb-1.2.1&amp;q&#x3D;80&amp;w&#x3D;2000" alt=""></div></a></figure><p>It’s been really nice letting out my creativity to balance the very analytical nature of my job as an engineer. Yin and Yang I guess and having a creative outlet makes me a better engineer, or at least a better person.</p><p>The emotion behind that short story is one of melancholy, and it's probably the emotion I most connect with. I’m not a depressing person, but somehow melancholy stirs me to my core. It connects me to the topic of death but in a poignant way, in a way that makes me <em>care about life</em>. It makes me care about choices and time spent with loved ones. It makes me be present - whether that's bouncing on the trampoline with my kids or walking my kids into school.</p><p>Melancholy is sadness, it's true. But it's a thoughtful sadness, and there is a beauty in sadness. It’s the hidden hope of the underdog, the downtrodden. It’s the unnoticed heroism. Melancholy is a nice and familiar friend. Pleasantly wallow in gloom, huddling under it's blanket; warm, lonely, but safe. Reminiscing of the good times, with tears of joy or sadness or both. For me, it's evidence that at least I can feel. That at least I’m alive.</p><p>By the way, the TV series "This Is Us" does an exceptional job of capturing the melancholic feeling for me - it's a great, great show.</p><h1 id="%F0%9F%8E%AD-haiku">🎭 Haiku</h1><p>During autumn / winter last year I wrote a haiku a day for 100 days. Haiku are short poems (three lines). I loved the creative outlet. It was also a bit like a mini diary too. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-bookmark-card"><a class="kg-bookmark-container" href="/blog/100-days-of-haiku/"><div class="kg-bookmark-content"><div class="kg-bookmark-title">100 days of haiku</div><div class="kg-bookmark-description">Haiku is a form of micro poetry; I did one haiku a day for 100 days and loved it</div><div class="kg-bookmark-metadata"><img class="kg-bookmark-icon" src="/blog/favicon.png" alt=""><span class="kg-bookmark-author">Nick J Stevens</span><span class="kg-bookmark-publisher">Nick Stevens</span></div></div><div class="kg-bookmark-thumbnail"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1523712999610-f77fbcfc3843?crop&#x3D;entropy&amp;cs&#x3D;tinysrgb&amp;fit&#x3D;max&amp;fm&#x3D;jpg&amp;ixid&#x3D;MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDMzNXx8bGVhZiUyMGF1dHVtbnxlbnwwfHx8fDE2NTI4MjE4ODI&amp;ixlib&#x3D;rb-1.2.1&amp;q&#x3D;80&amp;w&#x3D;2000" alt=""></div></a></figure><h1 id="%F0%9F%99%8F-breathing-mantra">🙏 Breathing mantra</h1><p>Here's little mantra I use to anchor to the present, relax a bit, and be grateful:</p><blockquote>When I breathe in I smile; when I breathe out I relax.</blockquote><h1 id="%F0%9F%92%AA-100-press-up-challenge">💪 100 press up challenge</h1><p>Next week I'll have finished my 100 press ups a day 28-day challenge.
